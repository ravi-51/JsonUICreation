# JsonUICreation
Please Create a new Project and just import the package in your project.
Then if you run the project Those ad card dates will change accordingly with the Json File(AdCard).
If you want to check where the Json File is added Go to Canvas at the end you can see the Json file.
Those SampleFormat-1 and SampleFormat-2 is the PreFab file I've created for Card UI.
If you want to change any detail of the card, at th run time tap on the card which you want to update (For Example- SampleFormat-1).
Now you can see the data on the inspector there we can change the details of the card.
If it's not updated just Turn-Off and Turn-On the perticular Game Object.
This much only I can do with the assignment given.
Thank you so much for the opportunity.
And Sorry for the delay.
